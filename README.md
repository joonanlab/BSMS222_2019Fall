## Biostatistics 
BSMS 222, Fall 2019
Time: Monday (5) and Wednesday (5)
Location: Room B125, Hana Science Hall, Seoul Campus

## Instructor
Joon-Yong An, PhD
Assistant Professor of Human Genetics
School of Biosystem and Biomedical Science, College of Health Science

# 1. General Course Information
## 1.1. Course Details
Coordinating Unit: School of Biosystem and Biomedical Science, College of Health Science
Level: Undergraduate 

## 1.2. Course Introduction
Statistics is fundamental in modern biology because it is integral in the design, analysis, and interpretation of experiments. The main aim of the course is to develop a critical understanding of the foundations of statistical application and data science skills in biological research. The course will introduce concepts and hand-on skills that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. 

# 2. Aims, Objectives & Graduate Attributes
## 2.1 Course Aims
The aim of this course is to familiarise students with the discipline of biostatistics and basic analytic skills. Students will develop an appreciation of modern application in biostatistics while gaining a detailed understanding of the analytic fundamentals from data modality to programming language. Over the semester, students will be placed into hardcore training in programming exercise. We are learning R, a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. 

## 2.2 Learning Objectives
After successfully completing this course you should be able to:

1  Understand the basic concepts in biostatistics.

2  Understand the basic skill sets in R programming language. 

3  Become confident in using R for data analysis.

4  Gain hand-on experience in data visualization.

5  Gain hand-on experience in data handling and wrangling. 

# 3. Learning Resources
